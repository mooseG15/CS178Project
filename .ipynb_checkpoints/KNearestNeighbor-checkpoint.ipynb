It was expected, as the commentary mentioned on the project writeup that the KNN learners would take some time to train and predict. The process was ended up being fast (30 minutes - 1 hour) and the resulting MSE was very low giving us good results for the FULL data set. As the results are seen above, the error on the training data was  < ~.41 and < ~.44 for the test data. Because the model starts underfitting for larger values of K we decided to move forward with neighbors less than K = 10, meaning taking the top 10 performers to store into the ensemble. "
